Possible modifications:
user adjusted sensitivity:
  currently the alarm goes off at a reading of 1500 which can be induced by a small smoldering piece of paper 1m. below the sensor
  outside air produces readings of <600
  stale air can produce readings of 750-850.
// I am not sure how high it can go, but i've been able to make it reach >2500 through smoke. It is less sensitive to lighter fuel, though. Haven't calibrated it using other gasses.
